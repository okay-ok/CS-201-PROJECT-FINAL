TO RUN, OPEN FOLDER IN VSCODE AND RUN “FINAL_CODE.cpp”
Expected output for default input.txt-181300

Code takes bidirectional graph as input 
Input file “input.txt”
Line 1 : V(VERTICES) E(EDGES) 
NEXT E LINES :
SOURCE SINK WEIGHT/capacity



Maximum flow is calculated from vertex 1 to vertex #V
Using dinic’s algorithm


To check your own graph modify input.txt as:
V E
then
E lines each: source_index sink_index edge weight
